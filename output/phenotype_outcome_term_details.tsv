POO:0000000
Term:phenotype outcome
Definition:The phenotype that results from a pathogen-host interaction.

POO:0000001
Term:loss of pathogenicity
Definition:The transgenic strain fails to cause disease that is observed in the wild type (i.e. qualitative effect).

POO:0000002
Term:reduced virulence
Definition:The transgenic strain still causes some disease formation but fewer symptoms than the wild-type strain (i.e. a quantitative effect).

POO:0000003
Term:unaffected pathogenicity
Definition:The transgenic strain which expresses altered levels of a specific gene product(s) causes the same level of disease compared to the wild-type reference strain.

POO:0000004
Term:increased virulence (hypervirulence)
Definition:The transgenic strain causes greater incidence or severity of disease than the wild-type strain.

POO:0000005
Term:effector (plant avirulence determinant)
Definition:Some effector genes are required to cause disease on susceptible hosts but most are not. A plant pathogen-specific term which was previously referred to as a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene. An effector gene is formally identified because its presence leads to the direct or indirect recognition of a pathogen in resistant host genotypes which possess the corresponding disease resistance (R) gene. Positive recognition leads to activation of plant defense and the pathogen either fails to cause disease or causes less disease. In the absence of the pathogen, effector delivery into a healthy plant possessing the corresponding R gene activates plant defense responses.

POO:0000006
Term:lethal
Definition:The transgenic strain is not viable. The gene product is essential for life of the organism.

POO:0000007
Term:enhanced antagonism
Definition:The transgenic strain shows greater endophytic biomass in the host and/or the formation of visible disease symptoms.

POO:0000008
Term:resistant to chemical
Definition:The transgenic strain grows and/or develops normally when exposed to chemistry concentrations that are detrimental to the wild-type strain.

POO:0000009
Term:sensitive to chemical
Definition:The transgenic strain which expresses either no or reduced levels of a specific gene product(s) or possesses a specific gene mutation(s), has the same ability as the wild-type strain to grow and develop when exposed to detrimental chemistry concentrations.

POO:0000010
Term:mixed outcome
Definition:A range of phenotype outcomes have been observed.
