Term:experiment specification
Definition:None given

ESO:0000001
Term:gene disruption
Definition:The ORF or intergenic sequences within the gene was disrupted due to transposon insertion or by the insertion of a resistance gene cassette.

ESO:0000002
Term:gene deletion
Definition:None given

ESO:0000003
Term:gene mutation
Definition:None given

ESO:0000004
Term:altered gene expression
Definition:None given

ESO:0000005
Term:biochemical analysis
Definition:None given

ESO:0000006
Term:functional test in host organism
Definition:The function of the gene was investigated by applying the protein to the host using a biological delivery system (i.e. expression of a stable transgene from the host, transient delivery with a virus, or transient delivery with Agrobacterium).

ESO:0000007
Term:gene complementation
Definition:The mutant phenotype was restored to wild-type by introducing a copy of the wild-type gene.

ESO:0000008
Term:sequence analysis
Definition:None given

ESO:0000009
Term:sexual cross
Definition:None given

ESO:0000010
Term:other evidence
Definition:None given

ESO:0000011
Term:gene overexpression
Definition:Gene expression was altered by changing the promoter/regulatory sequences. Gene expression is increased as a consequence.

ESO:0000012
Term:gene downregulation
Definition:Gene expression was altered by changing the promoter/regulatory sequences. Gene expression is reduced as a consequence.

ESO:0000013
Term:gene silencing
Definition:Gene expression is reduced by gene silencing using an RNAi approach.

ESO:0000014
Term:direct injection into host organism
Definition:The protein was injected into the host using a device (i.e. syringe needle).

ESO:0000015
Term:transient expression in host organism
Definition:The protein was transiently expressed in the host.

ESO:0000016
Term:characterised gene mutation
Definition:The UV or chemical gene mutation was characterised by sequencing or biochemistry.

ESO:0000017
Term:sequence analysis of sensitive and resistant strains
Definition:Sequence information of both strains were analysed to infer the gene function.

ESO:0000018
Term:sequencing of resistance conferring allele
Definition:Mendelian crossing was used to delineate the function of an allele.

ESO:0000019
Term:uncharacterised gene mutation
Definition:The gene was mutated using radiation (UV) or a chemical agent. The mutation itself is unknown.

ESO:0000020
Term:full gene deletion
Definition:The entire gene was replaced with a resistance gene cassette.

ESO:0000021
Term:partial gene deletion
Definition:A part of the gene was replaced with a resistance gene cassette.

ESO:0000022
Term:promoter mutation
Definition:Putative promoter region upstream of a gene was disrupted due to transposon insertion or by the insertion of a resistance gene cassette.

ESO:0000023
Term:cluster deletion
Definition:A small chromosomal region containing more than one gene was replaced using a resistance gene cassette.

ESO:0000024
Term:unknown gene expression
Definition:Gene expression was altered by changing the promoter/regulatory sequences. It is not reported if the gene is down- or up-regulated as a consequence.

ESO:0000025
Term:heterologous expression
Definition:None given

ESO:0000026
Term:chemical complementation
Definition:None given
