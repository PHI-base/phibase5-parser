"When kpp6 alleles were introduced in SG200 sho1/kpp6 double deletion mutant, which is unable to cause disease, symptom development was restored to the same extent with both the wild-type allele and the kpp6P130A P131A allele. Introduction of the kpp6 Del 1-169 mutant allele led to increased virulence compared with that of kpp6 or kpp6P130A P131A. The virulence enhancing effect of the kpp6 Del 1-169 allele was significantly higher in the sho1/kpp6 double deletion background than in the Del kpp6 background. N terminus of Kpp6 as well as the PRD alone have a negative role during virulence."

The lipA mutant was compromised in its ability to grow on olive oil as sole carbon source when compared with the wild-type. Transformation of the lipA mutant with plasmid pBBR1-lipA (complemented strain lipA/comp) restored both the growth and lipolytic activity of the mutant under these conditions.

"Application of a cAMP inhibitor atropine or theophylline, or IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) suppressed conidiation in the wild type or in the strains harboring a functional copy of AGA1. In contrast, cAMP or theophylline at 1 but not 10 mM partially restored conidiation in the T1 and T2 null mutants. / Null mutants more sensitive to KCl. "

Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101
"Elevated sensitivity to H2O2, seen for the Dnps6 null strain could be relieved by exogenous application of ferric iron. Mutants were more sensitive supersuperoxide-generating compounds, also to the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulphonic acid (BPTS at 200 m M), but not to a second iron chelator 2,2 ?-dipyridyl (2DP at 300 mM). On MM, the nitric oxide-generating compounds sodium nitroprusside (at 1 m M ) and hydroxylamine-HCl (at 5m M)reduced the radial growth of D nps6 mutants"
