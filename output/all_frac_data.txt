comment	There are big differences in the activity spectra of DMI fungicides. Resistance is known in various fungal species. Several resistance mechanisms are known incl. target site mutations in cyp51 (erg 11) gene, e.g. V136A, Y137F, A379G, I381V; cyp51 promotor; ABC transporters and others. Generally wise to accept that cross resistance is present between DMI fungicides active against the same fungus. DMI fungicides are Sterol Biosynthesis Inhibitors (SBIs), but show no cross resistance to other SBI classes. Medium risk. See FRAC SBI Guidelines for resistance management.

Several resistance mechanisms are known incl. target site mutations in cyp51 (erg 11) gene, e.g. V136A, Y137F, A379G, I381V; cyp51 promotor; ABC transporters and others. Generally wise to accept that cross resistance is present between DMI fungicides active against the same fungus.
