Introduction of the kpp6 Del 1-169 mutant allele led to increased virulence compared with that of kpp6 or kpp6P130A P131A. The virulence enhancing effect of the kpp6 Del 1-169 allele was significantly higher in the sho1/kpp6 double deletion background than in the Del kpp6 background. N terminus of Kpp6 as well as the PRD alone have a negative role during virulence.

In contrast, the deletion of CRZ1 did not affect the antifungal activity of ﬂuconazole. These results suggest that calcineurin is involved in azole tolerance via a Crz1-independent pathway in C. glabrata/ Decreased micafungin tolerance was observed in the  cnb1 and crz1 strains/  cnb1 strain showed decreased tolerance to both Congo red and calcoﬂuor white, the  crz1 strain exhibited only moder-ately decreased tolerance to Congo red and was unaffected by calcoﬂuor white exposure.

Mutants were more sensitive supersuperoxide-generating compounds, also to the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulphonic acid (BPTS at 200 m M), but not to a second iron chelator 2,2 ′-dipyridyl (2DP at 300 mM). On MM, the nitric oxide-generating compounds sodium nitroprusside (at 1 m M ) and hydroxylamine-HCl (at 5m M)reduced the radial growth of D nps6 mutants
